# My Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Repository

In order to refresh my web development skills after several years focused on building an energy business, I enrolled in [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) [Full Stack nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044). I kicked off the program in September 2020 and my estimated date of completion is November 2020.


## Program Description

The goal of the [Full Stack nanodgree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044) is to learn how to develop modern web applications. [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) approaches this by combining video- and text-based content styled as tutorials along with projects that reinforce those topics through hands-on experiential learning. Specifically, the program is broken up into three modules and capstone project.


## Module 1: Databases & CRUD

This focused on building data models, understanding databases and interacting with databases through [object-relational mapping (ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping).

The final project for this module consisted of building a platform site for booking music artists and venues. The project specification can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2653/view) and my application repository [here](https://github.com/dgamboa/udacity-fullstack-nanodegree/tree/master/projects/01_fyyur/starter_code).


## Module 2: API Development & Documentation

This focused on building [application programming interfaces (APIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) in order to control and manage a web application. I implemented the API backend in [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) and [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), tested the API endpoints using curl and connected the backend to a pre-built React frontend. I also practiced writing proper documentation via README files. Key topics included HTTPs, routes and TDD, among others.

The final project for this module consisted of building an API to play trivia. It consists of a database of trivia question and answers classified into various categories. Users have the ability to display questions, show answers, add questions, delete questions, search for questions as well as play a quiz game that randomizes questions and tracks score. The project specification can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2634/view) and my application repository [here](https://github.com/dgamboa/udacity-fullstack-nanodegree/tree/master/projects/02_trivia_api/final).


## Module 3: Authentication & Access Management

This focused on managing user authentication and permissions for a web application. The key topics discussed and implemented included password mechanics, integration of third-party authentication systems like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), utilizing [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) using [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and testing the system using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

The final project for this module consisted of building the backend for an application that can perform the following functions:
1. Allow customers to view the drink menu
2. Allow baristas to view the drink menu along with the recipe for each drink
3. Allow managers to view drinks and recipes as well as create new drinks and edit / delete existing drinks

The project specification can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2593/view) and my application repository [here](https://github.com/dgamboa/udacity-fullstack-nanodegree/tree/master/projects/03_coffee_shop_full_stack/final).


## Module 4: Server Deployment & Containerization

This focused on creating [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and deploying them to a [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) cluster using [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

The final project involved the deployment of a pre-built, super simple Flask application using [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). The project specification can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2637/view) and my application repository [here](https://github.com/dgamboa/udacity-kubernetes-EKS).
